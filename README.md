#Chetali Beniwal
---
I am chetali beniwal from jaipur, rajasthan fresher at Amrita School of Engineering(ELC 2022).

##My thoughts of tasks
So the tasks are not that really tough if you go step by step but it was not that easy for me to complete them as I was not able to understand them. But these are really helpful to improve your knowledge and inculcate a lot of things. So in a positive way it really helped me and I see a lot of change in my skills compared to before starting this.
##My Introduction
---
I am a first year student from ELC branch and I came to know about amFOSS from the orientation and after that I really wanted to get into this club to improve myself and my programming skills. I know a little bit of python in which I want to invest more of my time so I feel like amFOSS is very good for it.
